Hello Bokken enthusiasts!

hereby the instructions on howto build the Windows installer for Bokken:

1. Check if all files are present that are mentioned in the ** Required files ** section of this document.
2. Open bokken-installer-win-v11.iss using Inno Setup (Details about the installer's code is commented inside the installation script)
3. Hit CTRL+F9 to start making the setup


** Required files **

{scriptroot} python-2.7.10.msi
{scriptroot} pygtk-all-in-one-2.24.2.win32-py2.7.msi
{scriptroot} bokken-installer-win-minilogo.bmp ; shows up in the right top corner of the installer
{scriptroot} bokken-installer-win-logo-v2.bmp ; the main image of the installer
{scriptroot} bokken-installer-win-v10.iss ; the inno setup script
{scriptroot} bokken-installer-win\site-packages ; additional python packages
{scriptroot} bokken-installer-win\bokken ; bokken itself, note that there were a few fixes applied to these files in order to make it work under Windows


** A few more things to notice **

* Bokken's environment is effective immediately due the fact that the registry is NOT changed for the required paths, a .BAT file, bokken.bat, is responsible for that.
* Python 2.7 must be installed in C:\Python27, which is the default path and should not be too problematic, bokken.bat checks if c:\python27\python.exe exists
* Before Bokken ran, I've made a few code changes based off https://bitbucket.org/inguma/bokken/pull-requests/1/fixes-to-run-bokken-on-windows/diff

	Fix "TypeError: list indices must be integers, not str" on Windows
	Fix error during thumbnail generation on windows
	bokken.bat: explicit path to the python executable, pass all the arguments to bokken.py

lib/common.py:
removed: ansi_code = map(lambda x:'', ansi_code)
replaced: return string

ui/graph.py:
removed: cmd = "/usr/bin/dot -Tpng " + tmp_dot.name + " > " + tmp_dot.name + ".png" 
replaced: cmd = "dot -Tpng " + tmp_dot.name + " > " + tmp_dot.name + ".png"

The bokken.bat file has been changed as well but different than the fixes-to-run-bokken-on-windows suggest:
@echo off
title Bokken Console Window
if not exist C:\Python27\python.exe color 0c && echo ERROR^: Python.exe is NOT found^, please re-install. && PAUSE && EXIT
set path=%path%;C:\Python27\Lib\site-packages\graphviz-2.38\bin;C:\Python27\site-packages\radare2-w32-0.9.9\bin;C:\Python27\scripts;C:\Python27
python.exe bokken.py %*
